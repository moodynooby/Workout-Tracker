data.workouts.map((w, i) => ...):

    The .map() method is called on the data.workouts array.
    For each element in the data.workouts array, map executes the arrow function (w, i) => ....
    map automatically passes two arguments to this arrow function:
        The current element being processed from the array. You've named this parameter w (for "workout"). So, in the first iteration, w is data.workouts[0], in the second, it's data.workouts[1], and so on.
        The index of that current element in the array. You've named this parameter i. So, for the first element, i is 0, for the second, i is 1, etc.
    So, inside this specific map callback, w is the current workout object, and i is its numerical index in the data.workouts array.

workout.exercises.map((ex, i) => ...):

    This is similar to the above. map is called on the workout.exercises array (where workout is a specific workout object like data.workouts[0]).
    For each exercise in that specific workout's exercises array:
        ex becomes the current exercise object.
        i becomes the index of that exercise within that workout.exercises array. Important: This i is different from the i in renderWorkouts. They are in different function scopes.

Array.from({ length: ex.sets }).map((\_, j) => ...):

    Array.from({ length: ex.sets }) creates a new array. For example, if ex.sets is 3, it creates an array like [undefined, undefined, undefined].
    The map method then iterates over this new array.
    For each element in this new array:
        _ (underscore) is a common convention for a parameter that is provided by map (the element itself, which is undefined here) but isn't actually used in the function body.
        j becomes the index of that element. So, j will be 0, then 1, then 2 if ex.sets was 3.


        .map() callbacks: w, i, and j get their values because the map function is designed to pass the current item and its index (and sometimes the array itself) as arguments to the callback function you provide for each iteration.

Event Handlers: Inside event handlers for dynamically created elements, the script often relies on data-\* attributes that were set on those elements during their creation. The event handler can then read these attributes from the specific element that triggered the event (btn or input in your case) to "know" which item it's associated with.
